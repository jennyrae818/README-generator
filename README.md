## Description
We were tasked with making a command line application to generate a professional and high quality README file. Every project should have a README so this allows the user to quickly prompt and make a quality README file about their repository. Based on their input, a README.md file is generated with the title, description, installation, usage, license, contribution instructions, and contact information. 


## Installation 
You will need to install the dependencies, the inquirer package, run 'npm install' in your command line. Then to prompt the questions, use the command 
'node index.js'

## Technologies
node.js, inquirer package
